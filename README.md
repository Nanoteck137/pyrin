# Generated names for packages

## Code Gen
Spark – lightweight, evokes “starting point” or “igniting” a client.
Flare – suggests signaling or emitting something (like client code).
Kindle – fits with "starting" or "generating" something new.
Ignite – energetic, implies bootstrapping clients.
Ash – minimalist and clean, post-generation (like residue of server logic).
Blaze – more dramatic, but could work if generation is a core feature.

## New DB
Ember – keeping with the fire theme (Pyrin = a kind of fever protein).
Coal – another fire reference, stable core for data.
Basalt – formed from volcanic heat, stable, foundational.
Kiln – place where things are baked (models, data).
Cinder – subtle, short, still in the fire family.

## Doc Generation
pyrin/glow – subtle, continues the fire/light theme; glows expose detail.
pyrin/lumen – elegant, literal unit of light; implies clarity and documentation.
pyrin/beacon – a guiding light, fits well with APIs and discoverability.
pyrin/flame – a bit more intense, could fit if the docs are central.
pyrin/ray – short and bright, easy to remember.
pyrin/flare – was previously suggested for clientgen, but could work even better for doc generation (signaling).
pyrin/glint – subtle, fast flash of light, suggesting quick insights.

## Filter
pyrin/sift – short, elegant, means to filter or sort through something.
pyrin/chisel – fits with forge and ember; shaping data queries.
pyrin/ember (extended) – if this functionality is deeply tied to the DB layer (but better to keep it separate for clarity).
pyrin/flux – suggests transformation and flow between states (API → DB).
pyrin/taper – subtle, suggests refinement and narrowing.
pyrin/grain – evokes fine detail and sorting, like wood or sand.
pyrin/crux – the essential point; cool name if this logic is central.

## Validation
pyrin/anvil – evokes the place where inputs are tested and shaped; fits perfectly with forge.
pyrin/gate – implies a checkpoint where invalid data is stopped.
pyrin/sear – sharp, intense, implies thorough checking (maybe too intense?).
pyrin/proof – elegant, implies verification and integrity (like “proofing” dough or armor).
pyrin/screen – a physical metaphor for filtering/validating.
pyrin/trial – poetic, but implies data is tested under conditions.
